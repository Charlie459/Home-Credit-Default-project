# Home-Credit-Default-project

Individuals with poor or nonexistent credit face significant challenges in obtaining personal, home, or business loans. Those seeking loans often fall victim to lenders who impose excessively high fees and annual interest rates.

Home Credit aims to address this issue by tailoring its business approach towards individuals with limited or unfavorable credit histories, while avoiding predatory lending tactics. To achieve this goal, Home Credit must devise a method to assess the repayment capability of each loan applicant.

In this project, we will analyze the 'application_train' dataset provided by Home Credit and utilize Random Forest algorithms to predict which customers are more likely to encounter difficulties in repaying their loans. Through classification techniques, our objective is to develop a model with high accuracy and ROC-AUC scores to identify customers prone to payment issues.
